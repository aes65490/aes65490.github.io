	<div style="margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%"><p>The Florida Manatee is a subspecies of the West Indian Manatee, also known as the “sea cow”, and is an aquatic herbivore that lives in the coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. Typically, manatees live to be 28 years in age, so why is it that many now struggle to make it into adulthood? These cuddly creatures spend their days grazing and yet manatee populations in Florida have decreased over the past couple of decades predominantly due to human incidents. There are several causes of the issue, including red tides, cold water, global climate change, habitat loss, and human related accidents. They used to be plentiful in these waters but over the years increased fishing and chemical pollution from developing/ed coastal areas have caused issues with food and habitat loss and direct injury or death to the manatees. From 1996 to 2000 manatee numbers in Florida decreased from 2,639 to 2,222. Even though these animals are under the protection of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, boating accidents are still a very real threat to manatees today. </p></div>

		<div style="margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%"><p>Humans interaction with manatees can lead to several problems. Touching or interfering with manatees is against the law becuase if these creatures get too used to the presence of humans the lose the fear factor needed to swim away from boats. They are slow-moving already so if they are too trusting and do not get out of the way they can be hit by boats. Laws have been put into place to try to help protect these innocent creatures but it is difficult because they have recently been taken off the "endangered" list and put on "threatened". This is problematic because this change can make people less concerned with the immenent danger manatees are in because they have a false idea that they are safer now. In the winter especially, manatees gather in the warm springs of the Florida rivers so these areas must be protected from motorists and other forms of human interaction.</p>
		<p>In Florida, manatees are big part of the ecosystem and the economy. There are over <em style="font-weight:bold">forty</em> companies dedicated to swimming with and viewing the manatees. This tourism contributes a not insignificant amount of money to the economy. They are also a big part of the ecosystem because they eat the vegetation on the river floors, controlling potentially extreme spreading of the water grasses. Overall, these cuddly creatures need our help to be protected in their natural habitat.</p></div>
